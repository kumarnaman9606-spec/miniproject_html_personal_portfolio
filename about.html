<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate web developer who loves building clean, modern, and responsive websites. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with new ideas, and creating digital experiences that feel smooth and meaningful. Over time, I’ve developed strong skills in <b>HTML, CSS, Python, and C</b>, and I’m always excited to learn new technologies that help me grow as a developer.</p>


<p>Outside of coding, I’m someone who loves exploring and trying new things. I’m a big <b>football enthusiast</b>, and whenever I get the chance, I enjoy discovering new activities—like recently trying <b>paddle boarding</b>, which was an incredible experience. These interests keep me active, curious, and open to challenges, both in life and in my work.</p>


<p>Currently, I am pursuing my studies at <b>Delhi Technological University (DTU)</b>, where I continue to develop my technical skills and learn from a vibrant community of students and innovators.</p>
